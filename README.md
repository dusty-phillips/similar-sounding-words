# Similar sounding words

This is a list of similar sounding words that I have collected from various sources on the web
and added to as I find new pairs.

Unlike most homophone, homograph, and homonym resources this list is not targeting
ESL or educational use. Instead it is designed for finding common errors in speech recognition texts.
Specifically I use it with [Caster](https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for voice programming.

In addition to my custom file I currently have five different sources:
 *  https://7esl.com/homophones/
 *  https://web.ku.edu/~edit/wordsall.html
 *  http://www.singularis.ltd.uk/bifroest/misc/homophones-list.html
 *  https://www.teachingtreasures.com.au/teaching-tools/Basic-worksheets/worksheets-english/upper/homophones-list.htm
 *  https://www.thoughtco.com/homonyms-homophones-and-homographs-a-b-1692660
 
I preprocessed some of these files in a text editor and
random three Jupiter notebook available in the github repository
to generate the index.

All source files are copyright their respective authors.

## TODO
 * add mapping of words to numbers
